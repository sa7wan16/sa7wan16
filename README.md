I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective


I'm a BCA graduate with a strong foundation in technology. I've completed Google's data analytics and cybersecurity certifications, which have equipped me with practical skills in data analysis and network security. I'm eager to apply my knowledge in an entry-level role and contribute to a team that values data-driven decision-making and robust cybersecurity practices.
